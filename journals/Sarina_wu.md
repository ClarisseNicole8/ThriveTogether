Set up Docker and pgAdmin in preparation for the database creation.

06/29/2023
Added and migrated the following tables: 004_user_tags table, 005_messages table, 006_peer_connections table.
They all successfully showed up in pgAdmin.

Also created my Sarina_wu.md journal file.

07/10/2023
Added a "preferences" column to "users" table because it will be needed for the matching feature.

07/14/2023
Pair-worked with Chen today. Created the 009_peer_connections_update, 010_peer_connection_update, and 011_peer_table migration files.

The newly-created "peer" table will primarily make my PeerList.js easier to write especially when using the map() function to go through "peer" table. A crucial step!

07/17/2023
Created "create_connection" backend endpoint, which will create new rows in the "peer_connections" table, one of the most important endpoint of my part (I got three in total: create_connection, get_peers, and create_tag)!

Created a "get_users" backend endpoint (including get_users queries, get_users routers, etc), which will show all current users and got it functioning in FastAPI.

07/18/2023
Completed "get_peers" backend endpoint (get_peers queries, routers, main, etc), which is another important backend endpoint of mine!

Removed the "NOT NULL" constraints of the peer_connections table columns "sender_name" and "recipient_name" because it was throwing an error in Tanner's Docker.

07/19/2023
Created a PeerForm.js to add new rows to the "peer_connections" table. Later, pair-worked with Tanner and converted the PeerForm.js to a PeerButton.js, and added the "Add Peer" button on his matching page, so that he will pass the user data to my PeerButton, which will be added to the corresponding table in the database.

I also completed the PeerList.js, which will show all the peers on a separate page.

OMG. Today is a fruitful day. I completed both of my frontend JS files! So happy!

07/20/2023
The PeerList.js was throwing a console error, so worked with Tanner, SEIRS (Donald and Tracey), and the Instructor (Paul) to fix that.

Also worked with Tanner and was able to pass the current logged-in user's data to the PeerList.js, which was great!

Fixed Flake8 Issues (Ran flake8 command in the terminal to check and got no error remaining).

07/21/2023
Day-off today. Completed the "Create a Tag" backend endpoint (including queries, routers, etc), which enables creating new rows in the "tags" table in the database using FastAPI (we will be able to see the newly-created tags using "SELECT \* FROM tags;" statement in pgAdmin). This is the last one of my three main backend endpoints!

07/23/2023
Today is Sunday. Created "Peers Unit Test" to make sure the "get_peers" backend endpoint returns data correctly. Tested it out in the FastAPI terminal in Docker by running the "python -m pytest test" command and no failure showed up, which was great! This is another milestone!

07/25/2023
Optimized the look of my Peers page by changing "peer name" to "username" in PeerList.js. and deleting several other unnecessary columns.

Co-worked with Amanda and finally fixed the PeerList.js console error completely, by adding a new React useState hook (variable called peerDataLoaded) and adding an "if" statement in the JS file. OMG. So happy!

07/26/2023
Pair-worked with Clarisse and added data models (schemas) to ReadMe, referring to both pgAdmin and our migrations files. Four columns were included: "field", "type", "optional?", and "unique?".

07/27/2023
Had our project presented to the instructor (Zach) today. Made changes and fixed all bugs according to his feedback (with protected endpoints being a crucial part among others), which was awesome!! A huge relief.
