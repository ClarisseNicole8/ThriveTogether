### DAY ONE (6/28/23)
Today we all worked together to get the database up and running. I did it in VSCode while screensharing to everyone else and they helped troubleshoot as we ran into problems. We walked through the process together, up to and including the first merge request, which Amanda approved.

Then Amanda set up PGAdmin in the docker-compose.yaml and pushed that branch to main, which Sarina approved. We failed some pipelines along the way and I'm not sure what that's about but we'll figure it out. Afterwards the rest of us got PGAdmin running on our ends successfully! All in all, a pretty good day's work.
