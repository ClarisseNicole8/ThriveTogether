Today I worked on:
Preparation for the project

As a team, we set some dates for completion of the MVP, worked on our API endpoints, and added to our Trello board. Rosheen reviewed our project with us during our group project time.

Today I worked on:
Get Account Info and Update Account Info

I wrote the code for the back end endpoints in the accounts.py file to hopefully eliminate potential issues by creating an additional accounts file. I did not get to the routers yet and will work on that tomorrow. I wasn't sure where to start but once I started it made more sense to me. I will test these features after I write the code in the routers/accounts.py file.

Today I worked on:
Get Account Info endpoint and router

I wrote the code for the endpoint and the router in the backend and got it to work in FastAPI. I submitted a merge request and it was approved by a team mate after testing.

Today I worked on:
Update Account Info endpoint and router

I wrote the code for the endpoint and the router in the backend and got it to work in FastAPI. I added a class to our models file to accommodate the additional fields that will need to be updated once I begin work on the front end. The merge request was reviewed by a team mate and approved after testing.

Today I worked on:
Create an Account Form in the front end

Tanner and I pair programmed today and I got the Create an Account form working. The form populates data in the database. We got some errors and found that they were not thrown by the new code but a typo in previously written back end code. I will merge this feature on Monday when we are working together again and will then begin working on the Get Account Info and Update Account Info features.

Today I worked on:
Get Account Info in the front end

The Account Form was tested and approved by my teammates. I began working on the Account Info form in the front end. I did not complete this today and will continue to work on this tomorrow.

Today I worked on:
Trying to make my features look nicer.

I am working on the styling of my features today. This is not my strong suit but I am making some progress. I have changed the styling of my pages to look like the other existing features for consistency. I hope to complete this today. As a group, we are working on deployment. We have the front end deployed but the back end is giving us some trouble. The cli tool has broken so we are at a stand still until we hear back from an instructor. We hope to get the back end deployed today.

Today I worked on:
The ReadMe, clean up of code

We worked on the ReadME today. I cleaned up the API endpoints file and added a DATA_MODEL file while pairing with Sarina. We fixed bugs and cleaned up code.

Today I worked on:
Adding authentication to the Accounts endpoints and editing Account Unit Tests

We presented our project today and found that we were missing authentication on the Accounts endpoints, as well as on some other features. I added the authentication to the Get Accounts and Update Accounts features. We changed several of our unit tests to take in dummy data and worked on these until they passed. I got my test to pass and merged into main.
