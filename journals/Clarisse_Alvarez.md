Today I worked on:

Today I worked on:
Get Account Info and Update Account Info

I wrote the code for the back end endpoints in the accounts.py file to hopefully eliminate potential issues by creating an additional accounts file. I did not get to the routers yet and will work on that tomorrow. I wasn't sure where to start but once I started it made more sense to me. I will test these features after I write the code in the routers/accounts.py file.
